There should be a trained pytorch model here. It can be trained using the Training Model.ipynb file, or use the lame generic microsoft dialogpt.
The reason it is not in this git, is because the model is big, and github does not accept any files bigger than 100MB in size.
The model is around 500MB in size.
Training is very slow. If you have the gpu horsepower, use the gpu. On my cpu i trained it for 2 epochs, and it took about 30 minutes to do that.
